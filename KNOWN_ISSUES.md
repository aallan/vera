# Known issues

Bugs and limitations tracked against the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues). This file is a curated snapshot — the issue tracker is the source of truth.

## Bugs

| Bug | Issue |
|-----|-------|
| Closure parameter with pair-ABI type emits invalid WAT | [#359](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/359) |
| Opaque handle memory leak in host stores | [#346](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/346) |
| GC shadow stack pollution from opaque handle parameters | [#347](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/347) |
| GC worklist overflow for deeply nested object graphs | [#348](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/348) |
| `Exn<String>` handler tag fails — `String` is `i32_pair`, not a valid WASM tag parameter type | [#416](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/416) |
| Nested `handle[State<T>]` of the same type share a global state cell (inner handler corrupts outer) | [#417](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/417) |

## Limitations

| Incremental compilation | [#56](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/56) |
| Module re-exports | [#127](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/127) |

| CSV parsing and generation | [#236](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/236) |
| WASI 0.2 compliance | [#237](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/237) |
| Resource limits (fuel, memory, timeout) | [#239](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/239) |
| Http: no custom headers | [#351](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/351) |
| Http: no HTTP status code access | [#352](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/352) |
| Http: no request timeout control | [#353](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/353) |
| Http: browser uses deprecated synchronous XHR | [#355](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/355) |
| Http: no PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods | [#356](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/356) |
| Inference: `embed` operation (vector embeddings) | [#371](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/371) |
| Inference: no token/temperature controls (`max_tokens` hardcoded) | [#370](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/370) |
| Inference: no user-defined handlers (`handle[Inference]`) | [#372](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/372) |
| No float array host-alloc (`_alloc_result_ok_float_array`) | [#373](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/373) |

## Refactoring needed

Files that have grown beyond a comfortable size and need decomposition. None of these affect correctness — they are purely internal structural debt.

| File | Lines | Refactoring | Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| `vera/wasm/calls.py` | 8,337 | Split into subsystem mixins: strings, arrays, containers, encoding, parsing, conversions, math, markup, decimal | [#418](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/418) |
| `tests/test_codegen.py` | 10,019 | Split into feature-focused test files (literals, arithmetic, control flow, strings, arrays, collections, effects, data types) | [#419](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/419) |
| `tests/test_checker.py` | 5,522 | Split into phase-focused test files (types, functions, effects, contracts, modules, errors) | [#420](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/420) |
| `vera/codegen/api.py` | 2,228 | Extract memory layout utilities → `memory.py`; extract host runtime → `runtime.py` | [#421](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/421) |
