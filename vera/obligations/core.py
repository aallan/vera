"""Proof obligation reification — first-class verification units (#222 Phase A).

The verifier historically discharged contract obligations *inline*: each
``requires`` / ``ensures`` / ``decreases`` clause, ``@Nat`` subtraction
site, and call-site precondition was translated and checked at the point
it was encountered, leaving behind only summary counters and diagnostics.
That shape makes incremental re-verification (#222 Phase B) and proof
deltas (`vera/speculativeEdit`, Phase E) impossible to express cleanly —
there is nothing to diff or cache.

This module reifies each obligation as a :class:`ProofObligation` record:
a stable identity (owning function, kind, source span, expression text,
content hash) plus the discharge outcome (status, counterexample, error
code).  ``ContractVerifier`` constructs one record per obligation at the
existing discharge sites, preserving discharge order and solver-state
interleaving exactly — reification is observational, never behavioural.

Identity vs. outcome:

- *Identity* fields (``fn_name``, ``kind``, ``expr_text``, span) name the
  obligation across runs.  ``content_key()`` digests them into the hash
  Phase B's discharge cache will key on (extended there with assumption
  and ADT-context hashes).
- *Outcome* fields record what discharging produced this run.  The
  ``status`` vocabulary mirrors the verifier's summary bookkeeping:
  ``verified`` ↔ ``tier1_verified``; ``tier3`` and ``timeout`` ↔
  ``tier3_runtime``; ``violated`` ↔ an error diagnostic and
  ``tier3_unguarded`` ↔ a warning diagnostic (both excluded from the
  summary totals, matching the existing ``summary.total -= 1``
  convention at those sites).
