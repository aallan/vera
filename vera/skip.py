"""Codegen-internal control-flow exceptions for converting silent
skips into structured diagnostics (#626 Layer 3).

Two-tier design:

* :class:`CodegenSkip` — raised by a translator when an AST node shape
  is recognised but not yet implemented in the WASM backend.  The catch
  handler in ``_compile_fn`` / ``_compile_lifted_closure`` converts it
  to a source-located ``[E602]`` (body unsupported) diagnostic.  These
  are user-actionable: "this Vera construct doesn't compile yet".

* :class:`CodegenInvariantError` — raised when codegen encounters a
  state that should be impossible if type-check passed (e.g. a node
  the checker promised to reject).  These are *compiler bugs*, not
  user errors, and should never appear in production output.  The
  catch handler converts them to an ``[E699]`` "internal compiler
  error" diagnostic with a "please file a bug" rationale.

Why these aren't in :mod:`vera.errors`:

Every :class:`vera.errors.VeraError` subclass carries a fully-formed
:class:`vera.errors.Diagnostic` at construction time.  The codegen
skip path needs to *defer* diagnostic construction: the translator
that detects the unsupported shape doesn't know the enclosing
function name or its declaration span (needed for an accurate
"Function 'foo' body contains unsupported expressions" message).
The catch handler at the ``_compile_fn`` boundary has that context,
so these exceptions carry the raw ``(node, reason)`` and let the
catch handler build the structured ``Diagnostic``.

Migration plan (#626 Layer 3, Phase 2):

Before this refactor, every codegen translator that hit an
unsupported shape returned ``None`` and relied on the caller chain
propagating the ``None`` upward.  An audit identified 372 ``return
None`` sites across ``vera/codegen/`` and ``vera/wasm/``, classified
as:

* SILENT_SKIP (105) — caller propagates None without emitting a
  diagnostic.  This is the silent translator-skip class of bug
  #626.  104 were converted to ``raise CodegenSkip`` in PR #658
  (one borderline site reclassified to PROPAGATE on inspection).
* PROPAGATE (154) — pure None-forwarding after a sub-translation
  call.  Reachable only on PROPAGATE-of-PROPAGATE chains; many
  are now unreachable.  Track 1 cleanup tracked in #657.
* OPTIONAL_RETURN (74) — legitimate ``Optional[X]`` design (lookup
  helpers, inference helpers).  Left alone.
* INVARIANT_DEFENSIVE (39) — guards on type-check-impossible states.
  Candidates for conversion to ``CodegenInvariantError``.  Track 2
  tracked in #657.

See #657 for the full per-site audit table and the cleanup tracks.

Reachable None via the [E615] channel — DO NOT "clean up" every PROPAGATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tempting-but-WRONG simplification: "post-#658 every leaf raises, so every
``result = self.translate_expr(...); if result is None: return None`` forward is
dead — replace it with ``assert``/``raise``."  This is false.

``translate_expr`` / ``translate_block`` still return ``None`` *reachably* via
the #630 string-interpolation channel: when interpolation inference fails,
``_translate_interpolated_string`` records the failing segment to
``ctx._interp_inference_failures`` and returns ``None``.  That ``None``
propagates up through every enclosing translator and is turned into a loud
``[E615]`` (plus the ``[E602]`` function-drop) at the ``_compile_fn`` boundary,
which harvests the failure list.  So a forward of ``translate_expr`` /
``translate_block`` is **load-bearing PROPAGATE, not dead** — converting it to
``assert``/``raise`` turns a graceful ``[E615]`` function-drop into a crash
(caught empirically by ``TestE615LoudInterpolationFallthrough630`` when a #657
pass over-eagerly asserted such a forward in ``calls.py``).

Rule of thumb for the #657 Track-1/Track-2 audit:

* A ``return None`` that FORWARDS a ``translate_expr`` / ``translate_block``
  result (``if <x> is None: return None``) is **reachable** (via [E615]) and
  must be **preserved** — regardless of any ``# pragma: no cover`` on it.
* Only NON-forwarding guards — dispatch fall-throughs, shape guards on
  type-check-impossible states, and ``Optional`` lookup/inference helpers that
  do not forward a translator — are candidates for ``CodegenInvariantError``
  (INVARIANT_DEFENSIVE) or removal.

The #657 audit's INVARIANT_DEFENSIVE count over-counted precisely because it
tagged five ``operators.py`` operand/body forwards as INVARIANT when they are
in fact reachable-via-[E615] PROPAGATE; those stay ``return None`` (see the
``# #657 / #630 [E615]`` comments there).

    constraint path is guarded by the E613 gate (``_adt_satisfies_eq``)
    *before* codegen, but a direct comparison has no gate in front of it, so
    the translator checks derivability itself and raises this instead of
